She couldn't \"bear to part with her couch\", so I'm the one that has to move out. I KNEW she felt threatened by me... I could tell the first time she sat on me. So, I'm looking for a new room mate and potential best friend... someone that appreciates what I have to offer and won't drop me just because their girl tells them to. Honestly, I'm a chick magnet... girls love me! Probably why she felt threatened by me, you know? We had some really good times... and I was always there for him when he was too tired to stumble upstairs. Guess I'm still in shock... I never dreamed this would happen.", "", "So a little about me... I was separated from my parents when I was very young. My mother was a Queen (bed) and very highly respected. My father, however, was a common sectional couch and their relationship was looked upon as taboo in those days. When the Queen produced a couch & ottoman turd, I was quickly taken away and placed for adoption, as to not bring further shame to the kingdom. That's how I came to meet my best friend... he took me in and we formed a bond... a bond I never thought would break. We partied, we watched tv together... I even went to Outside Lands with him one year and crowd-surfed! It was amazing!", "", "So that's pretty much my story in a nutshell. Really hoping to find a new home soon. I adapt easily... I'm good in guest bedrooms, man caves... heck, even a garage would be cool! Think of the good times we could have together. I promise I'll provide you with lots of good memories and restful sleep! You can e-mail, call or text me. I'm around nights for you to try on. I'm anxiously waiting to hear from you and get this party started, my friend! Remember, it's first come first serve... whoever gets here first is my new best friend! I'm not waiting around..."]}
